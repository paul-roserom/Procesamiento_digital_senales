EMG DATASET

This dataset contains surface electromyography (sEMG) data of 5 different hand gestures performed by eight subjects. The data is store in a folder for each one of the subjects, each folder, contains 5 files, one for each gesture. The files contain the sEMG data of 4 sEMG channels placed on the forearm. The reader may refer to the following articles for more information about the dataset: LSTM Recurrent Neural Network for Hand Gesture Recognition Using EMG Signals and A Proposal of Bioinspired Soft Active Hand Prosthesis. The gustures are: open hand, closed hand, lateral pinch, signaling sign, rock sign.
